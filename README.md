### Git Basics

#### Introduction to Git and GitHub
The Coursera course provides basic knowledge and understanding of how git works, which is very useful for those who have not worked with version control systems.
I really liked how the visualization of the git commands was done.

#### Results

Working with git is nothing new to me. But it was interesting to repeat some of his commands that I don't often use in my work. Unfortunately for me, working with git worktree was not mentioned in these courses.
