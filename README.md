### Git Basics

#### Introduction to Git and GitHub
The Coursera course provides basic knowledge and understanding of how git works, which is very useful for those who have not worked with version control systems.
I really liked how the visualization of the git commands was done.

#### Results

Working with git is nothing new to me. But it was interesting to repeat some of his commands that I don't often use in my work. Unfortunately for me, working with git worktree was not mentioned in these courses.

### Linux CLI and HTTP

#### Linux Survival

As a user of the Windows system, I was very interested to learn more about Linux. Many of the commands mentioned in the course can be helpful when using git bash.

#### HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1 & Part 2

These articles make it clear what the HTTP protocol is. Much of the information presented needs to be read thoughtfully and several times.
The articles are very informative and do not immediately fit into my head, so I think I will return to them at least twice more for a more detailed understanding.

### Git Collaboration

#### Introduction to Git and GitHub

This course is a follow-up to Version Control with Git. In it, we will learn more detailed work with a remote repository and good practices of cooperation with other free software developers.
I don’t use 'pull requests' on a daily basis, so this topic was very interesting to me.

## Front-End Basics

### Intro to HTML and CSS

This section is filled with practice, which made me very happy. Html and css are not new languages for me, I studied them 1.5 years ago.
But there were also new moments for me. The section about semantic html and grid in CSS turned out to be very interesting.
Thanks to the free pro period at the Codeacademy, I passed all the practical sections and test tasks to test knowledge, which was very useful for me.
